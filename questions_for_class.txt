Why do I get an duplicate key error when creating a new user, despite having "unique: true" commented out or set to false?

Routing questions
    - What is the purpose of the "path:" in the get/post/create/delete routes in "controllers"? My getSingleUser route isn't returning a user when searching for an id value
    - Why doesn't my regex for matching an email work?
