### Description

The goal of the project was to build an API for a social network web application, using Mongoose and Express.js, where users share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list.<br>

### Usage

All of the setup required to test this application will be conducted from the command line.<br>

First you will need to install dependancies using `npm install`.<br>
Then you can start the server by running `npm run start`.<br>
Finally you will be able to test the application in either a dedicated API client such as `insomnia`, or your web browser<br>
